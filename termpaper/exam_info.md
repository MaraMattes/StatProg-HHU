# 1. Assignment (Term Paper)

We will upload the assignment on **January 6, 2026**.\
The submission deadline is **January 26, 2026** at **16:00**.


*Please read the following guidelines for the term paper:*

**Submission**
- The term paper is to be submitted by **teams of 3 students**. Send your term paper (IPYNB) to [mattes@dice.hhu.de](mailto:mattes@dice.hhu.de);\
Subject: "*MW122 Term Paper*"

**Groups**
- Each group is required to submit an independent solution and collaboration between groups is not allowed.
- In case you don't have a student group yet, we have prepared this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JM0eBFDnNVuTV2hAn3TnNTyhOVkRTTj5cCwxTJTZF8k/edit?usp=sharing). Here, you can insert your name and email address so that another student who is also looking for a group partner can contact you.


**Paper and Code**
- The title page of the term paper must contain the names and matriculation numbers of all students of the group.
- The paper should include the replicable and self-explanatory code and a readable documentation of your work. The documentation answers the (statistical) question in the exercise, explains the code and sums up your results in text form. Please provide concise and well thought-out answers and explanations. You can use in-line comments to explain what you do in a specific block of code.
- You may answer all questions either in German or in English.
- Try to solve as many exercises of the assignment as possible, even if you can't solve the exercise entirely.

**Grading**
- Among others, the final grade for your term paper will also depend on
    - Correctness and quality of the code,
    - Layout and Organization,
    - Quality of presentation of results (e.g. generating nice tables and figures),
    - Conciseness and quality of your answers and explanations.

# 2. Oral exam
